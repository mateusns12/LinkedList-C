Simple Linked List in C. Just plain basic implementation out of my  head, to remember how is it made. Not optmized, neither complete.

# Notes 

- The current List is a queue, where the first is always first, and new members are put in the end of the list.(Last In First Out)
- "first" pointer and "last" pointer keeps track of the data in their respective positions.

# To-do
- [ ] Implement Stack (FIFO)
- [ ] Implement Deletion
- [ ] Implement Insertion in place 
- [ ] Implement Delete Selected Methods
- [X] Create typedef for struct 
- [ ] Implement union
- [ ] Save list to file (sqlite3)
